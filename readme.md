# 🤖 GPT-2 from Scratch Implementation

## Overview
A from-scratch implementation of GPT-2, featuring modern attention mechanisms like Flash Attention and Causal Attention. This project aims to deeply understand transformer architecture by rebuilding it piece by piece.

## ⚡ Features
- GPT-2 architecture implementation
![GPT2 Architecture](Img%20GPT2%20paper.png)
- Flash Attention mechanism
- Causal Attention
- Decoder-only transformer
- Modern optimization techniques

## 🚧 Current Status
This is an educational project focused on implementation. Due to GPU limitations, the model remains untrained but the architecture is complete and ready for those with appropriate hardware.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- CUDA (requirements only)

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Deep understanding of transformer architecture
- Implementation of modern attention mechanisms
- Code clarity and documentation
- Educational resource for others

## 📚 Learning Resources
This project was inspired by and built using knowledge from:
- GPT-2 paper
- Flash Attention paper
- Various transformer architecture resources

## 💻 Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. (Optional) Configure GPU settings if available

## ⚠️ Note
Training requires significant GPU resources. This implementation focuses on architectural correctness and learning rather than practical application.
